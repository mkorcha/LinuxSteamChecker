		<p>This page was created for people considering switching to Linux full-time and want to see what they can take with them. Don't see all of your favourites? Never fear, you still have options! <a href="https://www.winehq.org/">Wine</a> allows you to run many games using a compatibility layer, and often you can find support for your favourite games to get it set up. You can also <a href="https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=162768">create a gaming VM</a> and run a Windows VM only for games at near-native performance, if your hardware supports it. Finally, <a href="https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WindowsDualBoot">dual booting</a> is also an option, though it can be inconvenient.</p>
